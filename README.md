# different-loss-functions-on-linear-regression
Experiments with different loss functions applied to linear regression.
-------------------------
This project has 5 headers
- Libraries(pandas, matplotlib)
- Data import(chatgpt made the datas) and scatter plot(matplotlib)
- Loss functions
    1. L2 loss
    2. L1 loss
- Partial derivatives using limit defination of differentiation
- Gradient decent
- Results


Since the project can use different loss functions as the imput of gradient decent u can add whatever loss function you want and see the results on three different small data sets.
